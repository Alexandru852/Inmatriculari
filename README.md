The purpose of this project is to check whether a registration number entered has insurance or not. If it has insurance, you can view more information about it, such as the date of issue and the date of expiration.
If the number exists and has no insurance, the program offers the opportunity to create one, asking for the start date and period (6 months or 12 months).
If the number does not exist, it can be registered and it is necessary to create insurance. The program is used only for registration numbers in Romania.
A "Storage" function has been created in the program to simulate a database, where registration numbers can be added at any time.
The project was developed in the C # programming language (.NET Framework 4.7.2) using the Visual Studio IDE using the Windows Froms Apps framework.
